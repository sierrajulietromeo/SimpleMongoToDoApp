# To-Do List Application

This project is a web-based to-do list application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. It features user authentication, session management, and uses MongoDB for data storage. Users can create, view, and delete tasks, as well as categorise them by priority levels (high, medium, low).

## Features

- User authentication system allowing for secure login and registration (currently disabled for new registrations)
- Session management for keeping users logged in securely
- CRUD operations for task management
- Prioritisation of tasks for better organisation
- Clean and responsive user interface (not really!)

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: The runtime environment for running JavaScript on the server.
- Express.js: The web application framework used to build the server.
- Pug: Template engine for rendering the UI components.
- MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user and task data.
- connect-mongo: Middleware for managing MongoDB-based sessions.
- express-session: Middleware for session management.
- MongoDB's Native Driver: For database interactions.
- CSS: For styling the web pages.
